## This repository has useful resources and code to learn about github and working with claims-based or administrative data-based case definitions of Crohn's disease.

### Our goal is for just about anyone to be able to create a dataset of Crohn's disease patients for analysis.  We'll show you how to identify Crohn's disease patients, count encounters and identify medications commonly used to treat Crohn's disease.  You'll learn many of the basic commands to create and look at your study data.  If you understand this code, you should be able to make an analysis-ready dataset for Crohn's and just about any other disease.

### Useful resources are on the main page. We have numbered the files so that a new user can open them in order and learn more about github, Crohn's and CMS/claims data.  You do not need to read the files about github and Crohn's and CMS data.  You can jump straight into the code folder.

### SAS code is available in the **code** folder.  Within the code are instructions on how to download the synthetic data used in the code.  Synthetic data is NOT real data.  You can't publish using this synthetic data source.  You can apply what you learn to just about any other claims or adminstrative dataset that has real data.    
-There is a beginner and advanced version of the SAS code.  If you are new to SAS, use the beginner.
